# Repository TFG -  Mario Mart√≠nez Angulo

This repository contains the Python codes used and the molecular dynamics simulations created during my undergraduate thesis, as well as the results, graphs, and images I obtained. The codes are separated into different files according to the purpose and section of each one.

1. Radius of gyration. Here you can find the codes for calculating the radius of gyration of HSA and the calculation of the maximum number of proteins on the surface through the method described by [M. Soloviev et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2021.07.072). You can also find images made by VMD of the HSA protein and the graphs of the code.
